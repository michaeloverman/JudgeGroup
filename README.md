# NYC Schools Challenge

A simple app written for the Judge Group as an example of coding. I used this as an opportunity to brush up on a few areas I haven't had enough practice using lately, such as:
- fragment navigation (ended up NOT using navigation JetPack, though)
- databinding
- ViewModels
- creating unit tests

Took the opportunity to create a ViewModelFactory for the first time, too, mostly just for fun...
Still a number of problems with this, most notably data persistence. That, and it's ugly.
